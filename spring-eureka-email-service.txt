This micro service has a one mission. It is send email. 
I use gmail api for it. You should have to one system mail. And configure it.(http://procaresupport.com/gmail-less-secure-apps-setting/)

To test you should add to mailInfo. For authenticated users mail. And you can add to mailInfo object to database like;

at SpringEurekaEMailApp.class  
public static void Initialize() {
		DbContext.Delete("1");
		MailInfo info = new MailInfo("1","acoount@gmail.com"); 
		try {
			DbContext.SaveMailInfo(info);
		} catch (Exception e) {
 			e.printStackTrace();
		}
 
		System.out.println("Finito");
	}
	
	

You should configure at MailSender.class to sendmail like ;
public class MailSender {
	public static void SendMail(Email email) throws NoSuchProviderException {

		String to = email.getDestinationAddress();
		String subject = email.getMailHeader();
		String msg = email.getMailContent();
		final String from = "account@gmail.com"; // System gmail adres
		final String password = "password"; // System gmail adres password
		
		

I add to databse every sending emails.

This service has two Apis.
One of them MessageConsumer.class has listener method for use ActiveMq,the other one EmailController.class has sendEmail api to use https request.
