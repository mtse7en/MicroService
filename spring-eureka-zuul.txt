It’s a proxy, gateway, an intermediate layer between the users and our services.

1- Maps between a prefix path like 

# Map paths to services
zuul.routes.user-service.path=/userservice/**
zuul.routes.user-service.service-id=user-service

# Map paths to services
zuul.routes.note-service.path=/noteservice/**
zuul.routes.note-service.service-id=note-service

at application.properties file.  It uses Eureka server to route the requested service.

2- It load balances (using Ribbon) between instances of a service running on different ports. And we use to configure timeout like : 

# Global - affects every Ribbon instances (not only your services but also Eureka client!)
ribbon.ReadTimeout = 60000

# Per service
<clientName>.ribbon.ReadTimeout = 60000

at application.properties file.
