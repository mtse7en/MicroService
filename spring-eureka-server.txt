It’s the naming server, or called service registry. It’s duty to give names to each microservice. Why?
No need to hardcode the IP addresses of microservices.
What if services use dynamic IP addresses; when autoscaling.
So, every service registers itself with Eureka, and pings Eureka server to notify that it’s alive.
